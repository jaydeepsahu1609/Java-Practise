/**
 * In some regions, students are homeschooled and rely on specialized tutors

 * (to keep program execution fast).
 * <p>
 * There is no fixed timetable â€” tutors arrive at the student's home at random times.
 * If a tutor finds that the student is already busy studying another subject,
 * they patiently wait for their turn.
 * <p>
 * While waiting, tutors log a message in the format:
 * "<Subject>-Tutor is waiting to teach <Subject>"
 * so that the student's guardian knows they arrived on time and are punctual.
 * <p>
 * Once the current lesson ends, the student becomes free. At that point, one of
 * the waiting tutors enters the study-room and begins teaching the student.
 * This process continues until all subjects have been taught.
